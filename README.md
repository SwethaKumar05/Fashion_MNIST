# Project Title: Fashion MNIST - Real-Time Fashion Item Recognition.

# Fashion_MNIST:

The "Fashion MNIST" project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can accurately recognize and predict the structure of various fashion items, such as shoes, T-shirts, shirts, and more, drawn on a blackboard. By leveraging the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of different clothing items, the project aims to enhance the interaction and visualization of fashion products in a real-time setting.

To achieve this, I experimented with different models, including Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and TensorFlow Keras models. The TensorFlow Keras model demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting the correct structure of the drawn fashion items. The model is trained to interpret the rough sketches and provide a refined, accurate visualization of the item, enhancing the user's experience in understanding and visualizing fashion products.

# CONCLUSION:

The project's success in utilizing deep learning techniques, particularly TensorFlow, showcases the potential of AI in the fashion industry, opening doors to innovative applications in virtual fitting rooms, fashion design, and more.
